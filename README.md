# Frontend Projects

This repository is a collection of various frontend projects created as part of my personal learning journey. The goal is to strengthen my skills across different frontend technologies and evolve from a backend-focused developer into a well-rounded **full-stack developer**.

## 🧭 Purpose

- Explore and practice a variety of modern frontend tech stacks.
- Build real-world UIs and interactive components.
- Strengthen understanding of the frontend ecosystem as a complement to my backend experience.

## 🚀 Technologies Covered

This repository may include projects built with:

- **Vue 3** (with tools like Pinia, Vite, etc.)
- **React** (including modern features like hooks, context, etc.)
- **Native JavaScript** (Vanilla JS – no frameworks, just pure JS to understand the fundamentals)
- **HTML/CSS** and modern layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid)
- Other tooling such as:
  - Vite
  - Tailwind CSS
  - REST APIs

## 💡 Background

I come from a backend development background and have experience with technologies like Laravel, Node.js, Spring Boot, databases, Vue.js. I am actively growing into a full-stack role, and this repository documents that journey on the frontend side.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder within this repository is a separate project or a focused technical demo. You can navigate into each to learn more and run them individually.
